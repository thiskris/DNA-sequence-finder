# DNA-sequence-finder
Finds DNA sequence types

# Result's stored in text file
1. **Region Name/Title**
   - Prints out the region name/title

2. **Sequence of Nucleotides**
   - Prints out the list of nucleotides the same as sequence in the text document

3. **Count Nucleotide**
   - Counts each type of nucleotide (A, C, G, T) in the sequence

4. **Calculate Nucleotide Mass Percentage**
   - For each type (A, C, G, T), calculates the percentage of that type in the sequence

5. **Report Codons**
   - Prints out codon list

6. **Report Protein Presence**
   - Contains at least 5 codons
   - Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) are 30% of the total mass
